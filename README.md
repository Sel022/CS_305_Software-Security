Software Security 
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial is in the banking sector and Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for its customers. The financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. Since financial institutions are being targeted by cybercrimes because of that vulnerability we have to build this banking system application with the high security protocols that will medicate the security risks Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for its customers. The financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. Artemis Financial wants to modernize its operations. As a crucial part of the success of its custom software, the company also wants to use the most current and effective software security. Artemis Financial has a public web interface. 

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
Artemis Financials’ existing software application and add secure communication ,To add a file verification step to a web application to ensure secure communications, the most effective way implement a checksum verification process where the application calculates a unique hash value (like MD5 or SHA-256) for the uploaded file on the server-side and compares it to a checksum provided by the client, ensuring the file integrity and preventing potential data tampering during transfer Specifically, Artemis Financial wants to add a file verification step to its web application to ensure secure communications. When the web application is used data; transfer data, the company will need a data verification step in the form of a checksum. We’ll deliver a production- quality integrated application that includes secure coding practice and protocols.


How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Software security add to a company’s overall well-being, since financial sectors are targeted by hacking and cybercrimes, we are building a very high priority for security risks for client’s software application to avoid any vulnerability, security risks starting from in the beginning of the SDLC, incorporating secure SDLC best practices is crucial in securing mobile banking applications. By effectively integrating security into every phase of the Software Development Life Cycle, from requirements to deployment and maintenance, developers can minimize vulnerabilities. This involves establishing security requirements, adopting a secure design framework, ensuring robust coding standards, thorough security testing, and ongoing maintenance for all applications. Leveraging these practices can significantly lower the risks tied to common vulnerabilities outlined above.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Choosing the right type of framework and dependencies, built tools is tedious and challenging in the beginning of the project preparation, in most enterprises, security teams are usually different from application teams. Given that they manage hundreds of applications, security teams are often accused of dumping thousands of open vulnerabilities on the application teams. Ineffective cross-team collaboration can hinder vulnerability management, leading to miscommunication and delays in addressing security issues. When IT, development, and operations teams do not align, critical vulnerabilities may be overlooked, and remediation efforts can become fragmented.
increase layers of security; multi-factor authentication: Require users to provide multiple forms of identification like passwords, SMS codes, or biometric data for logins. Strong password policies: Enforce complex password requirements and regular password changes. Role-based access control: Grant users only the necessary permissions based on their job function
To assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use as flows 
We can implement, Key steps in vulnerability assessment and mitigation: 
Identify assets: Create an inventory of all systems, applications, and network devices within app’s environment to understand what needs to be scanned. 
Also adding a scanning tool: Select a vulnerability scanner suitable for our network size and complexity, considering factors like the ability to scan different operating systems, applications, and network protocols
Software applications were functional and secure, introduced new vulnerabilities?
Maintaining a complete and exhaustive set of passing tests will ensure our Refactoring does not cause regression errors in app’s code to go undetected. Indeed, whenever make a small change, should re-execute the existing tests as a safety net in order to check that codes didn’t modify the expected behavior.
To ensure a software application is both functional and secure, developers need to implement a robust development process that includes thorough testing, regular code reviews, secure coding practices, vulnerability scanning, threat modeling, and maintaining updated dependencies, while prioritizing security throughout the entire development lifecycle
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Spring Boot is a framework that can help developers build Java applications more quickly and easily. Some of its advantages include: 
Reduced development time
Spring Boot's opinionated approach to the Spring framework reduces the time spent on repetitive tasks and decisions, allowing developers to focus on creating and testing applications. 
Less boilerplate code
Spring Boot reduces the amount of boilerplate code, annotations, and XML configuration that developers need to write
Input validation
Checks user data and network data for errors, malicious code, or unexpected values. 
Output validation
Sanitizes data sent to the user or network for sensitive information, escape characters, or formatting issues

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I have learned ,I am familiar with SDLC  , I did participate in in  manual and lately automation testing with non-sophisticated applications development but in this Artemis Financial it’s a real time hands on experience felt the pressure to implements security measures to sage guard the banking applications security  risks , I learnt  major SDLC  frameworks and tools and dependencies  maven built ,test ,verification , then Spring boot frameworks it huge subsets of many libraries and add on to developed a secure applications ,I am still learning all necessary branches of this frame works it  endless future surprise  the  develop peers I am interesting to learn more about this framework to improve my knowledge.
